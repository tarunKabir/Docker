Problem  : Create a bridge network called frontend that will be publicly accessible.
Create a second bridge network called localhost that will be internal.
Deploy a MySQL container called database that will use the localhost network. Use the mysql 5.7 image:

Use the -e flag to set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to "P4ssW0rd0!".
The MySQL container should run in the background.
Next, deploy a second container called frontend-app. Connect it to the frontend network using the --network flag. Use the latest Nginx image. The Nginx container should run in the background.

Once the Nginx container is created, connect it to the localhost network.

Solution : 
Create the frontend network
Use the docker network to create the frontend network:

docker network create frontend
Create the localhost network
User the docker network command to create the localhost network:

docker network create localhost --internal
Create a MySQL container
Create a MySQL container that is attached to the localhost network:

docker container run -d --name database --network localhost -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4ssW0rd0! mysql:5.7
Create an Nginx container
Create an Nginx container that is attached to the localhost network:

docker container run -d --name frontend-app --network frontend nginx:latest
Connect frontend-app to the internal network
Connect frontend-app to the localhost network:

docker network connect localhost frontend-app
